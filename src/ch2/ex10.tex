From the proof in \hyperref[ch2ex:9]{Exercise~\ref{ch2ex:9}}, it follows that in
any graph of degree $6$ there exists a subgraph $H$, such that either $H$ or
$\overline{H}$ is isomorphic to $K_{3}$. Equivalently, in any gathering of six
people (a graph $G$ with $v=6$) there are either three people who are mutually
acquainted (a subgraph isomorphic to $K_{3}$) or three people who are mutually
unacquainted (a subgraph whose complement is isomorphic to $K_{3}$).
