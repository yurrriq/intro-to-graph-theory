Let $S$ be the collection of all sets that can be described in an English
sentence of twenty-five words or less. $S$ is not a set, because $S$ can be
described in fewer than twenty-five words, and if it were a set, then $S$ would
have to be a member of itself, which violates the axiomatic definition of a set.
